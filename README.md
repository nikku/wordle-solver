Get a little help solving your [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) puzzles. 


## Usage

```
$ npx @nikku/wordle-solver

@nikku/wordle-solver solves a Wordle for you.

We'll provide you with a word to input to Wordle.
You feedback the result as a [+-???] encoded string:

  + = match
  ? = contained
  - = no match

-----

Attempt #1 --- Choose cares
Enter result [+-???]: -?--?

  â¬œðŸŸ¨â¬œâ¬œðŸŸ¨    cares    p=0.00, matched=_____, letters=[...](26), words=[...](12947)

Attempt #2 --- Choose spalt
Enter result [+-???]: ?-??-

  ðŸŸ¨â¬œðŸŸ¨ðŸŸ¨â¬œ    spalt    p=0.02, matched=_____, letters=[...](21), words=[...](196)

Attempt #3 --- Choose usual
Enter result [+-???]: +++++

  ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©    usual    p=0.05, matched=_____, letters=[ u, s, a, l, y ], words=[ usual, lyssa ]

Well done!
```


## The Algorithm<a name="algorithm"></a>

It chooses the next word that reduces the solution space (available words), as much as possible:

* Scores letter occurance per column
* Derives a word score
* Adds a penalty for letter duplicates 
* Uses matched slots to guess / exclude likely letters

Uses `cares` as the initial word.

Implemented in [`lib/solver.js`](./lib/solver.js), shows [decent performance](#performance).


## Performance

The [algorithm](#algorithm) __solves 99%__ of all puzzles in an average of __4.3 steps__.

$ npm run bench
